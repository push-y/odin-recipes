        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside until needed.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon butter and oil in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add shrimp, 2 tablespoons parsley, and dill; cook until shrimp are bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate, leaving any cooking juices in the pan.</li>

            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour until fully combined and starting to turn golden, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Whisk in chicken broth until combined, then repeat with milk. Stir in tomatoes, lemon juice, salt, and pepper; bring to a simmer.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Add 1/2 cup Parmesan and Romano; stir until cheeses begin to melt and sauce is creamy. Add 1 tablespoon mozzarella cheese, then mix in 1/2 of the cooked pasta. Add more pasta if there is enough sauce to coat it. Stir in shrimp, then top with remaining mozzarella, Parmesan, and parsley.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden on top and bubbling around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes.</li></ol>
